    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p id = 'main'>My name is Kevin Yang, I am from Ridgefield, Connecticut, and  I am a 3rd year CS major with a concentration
        in Human-Centered Computing at Northeastern University. Last semester I did my 
       co-op at Northeastern, I was conducitng research with a researcher at the POEM Lab. I created
   a new methodology of implementing lightweight domain-specific programming languages in the Jupyter 
   Notebook IDE. I'm involved with several clubs at Northeastern, and I am a Software Developer for Scout and the Student Government Association. 
   I have a lot of experience working with various backend and frontend technologies, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node, MySQL, MongoDB, 
   Flask, Python, etc. One of my favorite projects that I've worked on while at Northeastern was developing a full-stack web application to display various 
   data visualizations about the demographic information in Knox County, Maine. I created a backend API using Flask which retrieved data from a CSV file, and then 
   I made several endpoints which performed cleaning on that data and prepared it to be used in the data visualizations. The library I used for those data visualizations was 
   Holoviz. That project taught me a lot of experience working with Python and React, and I learned a lot about web development.</p>
